        <p> chupacabra, in Latin American popular legend, a monstrous creature that attacks animals and consumes their blood. 
            The name is derived from the Spanish words chupar (“to suck”) and cabra (“goat”) and can be translated as “goat-sucker.”
            As a fearsome but probably nonexistent creature, the chupacabra has been characterized as the southern equivalent of the Sasquatch.  </p>
